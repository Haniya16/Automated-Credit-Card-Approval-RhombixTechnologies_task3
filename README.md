Automating Credit Card Approvals with Machine Learning!

## Key Highlights of the Project:
1. Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling for clean input.
2. Class Imbalance Handling – Implemented SMOTE to balance the dataset and improve predictions.
3. Model Training & Optimization – Used Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning for enhanced accuracy.
4. Threshold Adjustment – Leveraged Precision-Recall Curve to determine the optimal decision boundary.
5. Performance Evaluation – Assessed accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix visualization.

## Key Learnings:
1. The importance of data preprocessing in real-world ML applications.
2. How adjusting decision thresholds impacts model performance.
3. Effective strategies to handle imbalanced datasets for better predictions.
